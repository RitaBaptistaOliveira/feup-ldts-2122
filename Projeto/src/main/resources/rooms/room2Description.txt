As you enter, you see the entrance door to a house.The tree has a tree hollow.
Next to your feet there's a worm, a hole in the ground, probably its house. It's its own little world.
There is also a bulletin board.
All of this combined with the nice river flowing gives you goosebumps. You feel at home.
