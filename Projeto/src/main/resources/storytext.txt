You have been preparing this for a year. You wonder which rumours about the secret are true. Some say it's money or a rare collectable. Others say it gives you what you most want.
But no one was ever able to complete the mission, so it can be all lies.
Suddenly you feel a chill down your spine. You start to ask yourself if it'll be any different with you: will you even be able to complete the mission?
Everyone before was more skilled than you. Why would YOU be able to reach and enter the house and find the code when most only reach half the code and quit.
It can't be that bad. At least that's what you tell yourself.
As you enter the forest you feel the winter wind graze your skin. You are ready.
